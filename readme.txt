An ant make fle was attenpted, but I am facing difficulty in including the the junit jar file along with the project. Hence did not do it, although TestCreature can be compiled using it.

The project only needs to be imported as a new Java project in Eclipse and can be worked on directly, the java source files are kept in the src folder.

The package/project has the name assignment 1 although this is homework 1 

For the TestCreature, that class needs to be opened and can be run directly in eclipse.

Whereas the Junit test suite can be opened and pressing run will run the test suite.

to run just the TestCreature, the terminal should be set to the source folder, and ensure ant and open jdk the latest one is installed, the file can be run using the ant tool.
